# Person App

This app uses random user data from randomuser.me to display a list of users.  The profile picture on each user in the list is a link to a detail page
about that user. It begins with data for 10 users and the 'Get More Results' button on the list view will fetch one more user with each click.  When adding users, 
they are displayed 10 per page and the 'Previous Page' and 'Next Page' buttons allow navigation.
